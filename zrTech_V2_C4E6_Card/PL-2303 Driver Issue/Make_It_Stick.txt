Warning Letter on Counterfeit Products   Hot News

Warning Notice:

It is confirmed that counterfeit (fake) PL-2303HX Rev A USB to Serial Controller ICs using 
Prolific's trademark logo and device drivers were being sold in the China market. 
Counterfeit IC products show exactly the same outside chip markings but generally 
are of poor quality and causes driver compatibility issues. We issue this warning 
to all our customers and consumers to avoid confusion and false purchase. 
Only buy from Prolific authorized distributors.

civil and criminal courts according to the trademark, copyright, and intellectual properties laws

PL-2303HX Rev A (or PL-2303HXA) also has been discontinued (EOL) since October 2012 and does not support Windows 8 onwards. Prolific advises users to purchase cables/adapters with PL2303HXD (HX Rev D) chip.

**********************************************************************************************
Prolific has followed the lead of FTDI and disabled these older chips in their newer drivers
This leaves people with the chip stranded.
It's not a matter of buying a new adapter cable when the part is built onto a board.

Tested on W10 family and pro, 32/64 bits.
The solution for old PL-2303 HXA/X : use a driver release older than 3.4.

Edit: The procedure above works, but only temporary. Each time you turn your computer off, 
the latest driver is reloaded due to windows auto-update (or if you unplug and plug again the device into USB port).

To avoid that, a recent turnaround exist and has been published by Microsoft. 
It's a tool named wushowhide.diagcab ("Show and Hide Update"). 
It allow to inhibit the auto-update for a particular program or driver (Prolific in our case).
For more informations and where to download this tool, take a look at this article : KB3073930

I have tested it and it work fine. The only problem with it, is that, 
it reload the latest driver when you plug the device on a never used USB port. 
So, if you change place of connection, you should manually set the driver to 3.3, 
but you have to do that only the first time you used this port. 
Next time, the driver remain to 3.3 and never upgrade to 3.6.
